Since I have to run all the code locally, please leave the files I push unchanged. If you want to add your own code for me to run, add a new script with the following filenaming convention: 'YYMMDD_name_oldscript', where YYMMDD is a date, name is your name, and oldscript is the name of the old script you have adapted. I will then run your script locally, resolve errors and merge it with my own script.
